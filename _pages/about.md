I am currently an undergraduate research assistant at Wang Lab [Link](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yongwangISB), College of Life Sciences, Zhejiang University and a visiting scholar at Wu Group [Link](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/peoples/wuhao), Institute of Natural Sciences, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in biochemistry from University College London, UK. 

My research focuses on developing novel AI-based enhanced sampling or mathematical modelling methods for molecular dynamics simulations. I am also interested in their direct applications in biomolecular systems to improve our understanding of these complex systems. [*See research for more information.*](/research/) 

I am planning to join a Master's Degree programme in bioinformatics starting from September 2025, preferably in Spain or Italy and I am determined to pursue a PhD after graduation in the area of my current research interest (AI4MD). **Currently, I am quite flexible and actively looking for various opportunities:** 

- **Full-time Research Assistants before Sep 2025** in Hong Kong, UK, US or continental Europe. For UK/US/EU, I am willing to continue part-time during my Master's study and later join the lab as a PhD student.
- **Funded PhD in UK or US starting at the earliest convenience**.
- **Research opportunities during my Master's study** in Spain or Italy. 

You can find my [CV](/cv/) here. You are welcome to contact me through email at [mingyuanzhang@zju.edu.cn](mailto:mingyuanzhang@zju.edu.cn).
